      <h2>My story</h2>
      <br>
      <p>My name is Philip and I grew up in a small village in the eastern part of switzerland. I was always a very active child and also started to learn to play the piano and later the guitar.
            My favourite sport to play was soccer which I played from 6 to 24 years of age. 
            I went to school in the same village that I grew up in and later went to the "Gymnasium" (High School) in a nearby city.
            After I got my Matura (High School Diploma), I went on to doing the military service which is mandatory for all men in switzerland.
            The military service was not always easy, especially in the beginning, but as a whole the service was
            a good experience and there are always many stories to tell from this time. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
          After I finished my military service I went on to study Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zürich.
          At this time in my life I was not sure if this was the right thing to study but as everybody always
          says: "You got to do something". So I went on and started my Bachelor's program at ETH. At the beginning it was All
          going pretty well and also the subjects were interesting but as time went on I realized that this field of study
          would not be fitting for me in the future. This realization came when I had the first physics university classes.
          I got really into physics and decided that I want to follow this path further. I decided to complete the Bachelor's 
          degree in Health Sciences and Technology since there was only one year left to complete the diploma.
          After I got my diploma I decided that I wanted to study Electrical Engineering since I really wanted to do 
          something with alot of physics but also give myself the posibility to go into the direction of 
          Computer Science / Computer Engineering.

        Computer Science / Computer Engineering.
        The physics courses were great during the Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and during the 
        Master's program I had the chance to shift my focus more towards Computer Science. The main focus
        during the last year of my Master's program was Machine Learning. I learned alot about CNN's, LSTM's, Transformers
        and all the different techniques used in Machine Learning. After all that I'm still eager to learn
        more in the field of Machine Learning and more general in the field of Software Engineering. 
      </p>

          Now after all stuff about school / university, I'm also going to talk about what
          I like to do currently to recharge my mind. As I mentioned at the beginning I learned to play
          the piano at around 8 years old. During the last two years I rediscovered my passion
          for playing the piano and it's now one of my most important hobby. I also still like to 
          play the guitar but not as much as the piano at the moment. Making music alone is nice, but
          it is even more fun when you can share it with friends. That's why I like to jam with 
          my friends who have their own studio in their flat. 
          As you can see, music is a big part of my life. One other thing that I like to do in my 
          sparetime is sports. I like to go to the gym or play table-tennis, during the summer I like
          to swim in the "Limmat" river here in Zürich.
